# Generative Art Ideas

A short list of experiments to try with p5.js in this repo.

1. Perlin Noise Landscapes

   - Multi-layered noise fields mapped to color palettes.
   - Animated time-evolving noise for flowing visuals.

2. Particle Systems with Attractors

   - Thousands of particles influenced by attractor points and noise.
   - Record frame-by-frame exports to make video loops.

3. Reaction–Diffusion

   - Implement Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion and colorize patterns.
   - Explore parameter sweeps and export interesting states.

4. Cellular Automata (2D/Continuous)

   - Conway-like rules and continuous CA for textured patterns.
   - Use randomness + symmetry to produce prints.

5. Flow Field Typography

   - Use text shapes as boundaries for particles moving in a flow field.

6. Shader Experiments (WEBGL)

   - Small GLSL shaders for noise, feedback, and kaleidoscopic effects.

7. Generative Collage Pipeline
   - Combine image assets from `resources/images/` with procedural patterns.

Notes

- Start simple: pick one idea, make a minimal sketch, iterate.
- Keep `outputs/` for high-res renders; don't commit large files.
